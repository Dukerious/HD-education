Note: if you need to promote a value, you must promote the smaller 
value from the available alternatives (if any). Justify your answer.

     tree after the insertion of the value 8? 
     Justify your answer.
     12 35 60, 
     since after insert 8, the node not full.


(a2) What value(s) would be stored in the node that now contains 8? 
     Justify your answer.
     1, 7, 8, 
     since the node not full, not promotion need.


(b) 
(b1) What value(s) would be stored in the root node of the above 2-3-4 
     tree after the insertion of the value 50? 
     Justify your answer.
     its 12.
     since after insert 50, the node(36, 44, 57), its full, and after first
     promotion, the root node also full, so keep promotion.
