Question 1

(a) What is the maximum input size that can be processed? Justify your
    answer.

1000 * 2^(10) = 2^n
2^n = 1000 * 2^10
n = log2(1024000) -> 19

(b) Which of the two algorithms is more efficient? Justify your answer.
Binary search searches -> O(logn)
Quad search searches -> 3*O(log4n)
So, when logn < 3log4n -> n > 1
thus, binary search searches more efficient

(c) What are the time complexities of fnA() and fnB() in terms of a and
    b? Justify your answer.
    fnA() -> O(b- a + 1)
    fnB() -> O((b- a + 1)^2)
