Question 4

Which of the given algorithms could have been used to construct the
mininum spanning tree? Justify your answer.

Kruskal's Algorithm.

The MST algorithm are Kruskal and Prim.
But according to the edge insert orders, it can not be Prim.

Since In Prim' Algorithm, 
when we insert an edge e, the one of the vertex, should be used.
