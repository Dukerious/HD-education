Question 2

Explain why the compilation error occurred and briefly describe how it
can be fixed.

Only typedef the graph pointer but not complete define the content inside the struct.

method1:
    use buildin function inside the graph.h, not directly visit the graph struct.
    Which means use an interface.
method2:
    declare the graph struct details in graph.h, not just pointer.
