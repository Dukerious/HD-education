Question 5

(a) Describe and justify the steps you would take to determine which
    sorting algorithm the program uses.
    
compare their execute time. the selection sort should be display O(n^2) and quick sort should be O(nlogn)


(b) Is the sorting algorithm that the program uses stable? How confident
    are you in your conclusion? Explain your answer.

Only for this input, it seems like it is stable
But may be is coincidence, we can't say 100% it is stable.
